# Web Dev ðŸ•¸ Resources ðŸ“– 
## Let me tell this TBH Iam overwhelmed by the number of Resources for Web Dev, I was confused from where to learn and didnt made any progress for 1 year.

### I purchased ["The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) 8 months ago and didn't even open it once.

Now I might refer it but I just wanted to tell that how lazy I was/ I am.

Let me share a few overwhelming amount of resources!

It's a bad idea to refer to only one resource in Coding,Development but at the same time it will reduce your completion rate and productivity.
