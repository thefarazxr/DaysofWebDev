Day1 of #100DaysOfCode as already knew bit HTML, CSS I was busy
tweaking my ghost CMS blog theme which use Handlebars templating
language and also today I found that unformatted css code(looks
horrible) can be shown in clearer format by Shift+opt/alt+F (VS code).

Day1 of 
#100DaysOfCode watched and learnt a bit (not in depth though) about how ghost cms
themes work [@paulhalliday_io](https://twitter.com/paulhalliday_io)
